File names should be in lower case and follow the pattern of their router subdomain. This means routers that have two words will have a hyphen between them. If we make a router for the subdomain "contract-users-teams" the file will be named docs/api-documentation/endpoints/contract-users-teams.md.

## Endpoint documentation format

Each file should be a router file.
Include an example of the reqeust in curl and the response in json.

Minimize the user of bold text. Never use it in section headings or the beginning of a listed item.

Each endpoint should have its own section with a heading that follows the pattern of the endpoint.
